We are not gonna talk about primitive data structures like int,bool,float,byte etc..

1.>>> ARRAY---  most basic and important data structures ,it is in-built in any modern languages ,It helps in storing and retreiving
                the data in O(1) of time due to contiguous allocation of memory in arrays.


2.>>> Linked lists--- Same in structure as of an array but memory chunks are not contiguous and are connected with each other
                       using address pointers.

3.>>>  STACKS---    same structure as array or lists but follows lifo or filo principle and can be implemented using array or
                    linked lists.
4.>> QUEUE---   queues are very similar to stacks .... only difference is they follow fifo operation and not lifo as compared                   to stacks.
